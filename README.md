# AVR Tutorials for Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV)
These tutorials assume that you are familiar with using the Arduino IDE and language. Do check out the other [repo](https://github.com/cyccheung/ArdTutorials) if you are not.

## Datasheets
You should be at least comfortable with looking for solutions in component datasheets by now. With AVR, you now need to start looking at ATmega328P's datasheet a lot more often. It is a very long datasheet and you might not understand a lot of what they are saying (I do not either). But having said that, there is still a lot of information in there that you need. The bits to set to change an interrupt's behavior and code examples are just a small fraction of the things in there.

## Feedback
Constructive feedback on my code is always welcome as usual. If there are errors or code that should be explained better, do send me an email and I would be happy to learn from you.
