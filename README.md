# TUTORIALS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION

# AVR Tutorials for Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV)
These tutorials assume that you are familiar with using the Arduino IDE and language. Do check out the other repo if you are not.

## Feedback
Constructive feedback on my code is always welcome as usual. If there are errors or code that should be explained better, do send me an email and I would be happy to learn from you.
